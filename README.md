# personal-website (To become CS-Portfolio-Builder)

Welcome to my repository! While this project started as a personal portfolio, it is now going to be a portfolio building web app for other users, with the goal of tailoring to Comp Sci students, to share themselves and their work.

Built with TypeScript Next.js and React.
